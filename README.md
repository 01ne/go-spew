go-spew
=======

Go-spew implements a deep pretty printer for Go data structures to aid in
debugging.  It is still under initial development, so some of the formatting
output is likely to change, however it is already quite capable.   It is
licensed under the liberal ISC license, so it may be used in open source or
commercial projects.

If you're interested in reading about how this package came to life and some
of the challenges involved in provide a deep pretty printer, there is a blog
post about it
[here](https://blog.cyphertite.com/go-spew-a-journey-into-dumping-go-data-structures/).

## Documentation

Full `go doc` style documentation for the project can be viewed online without
installing this package by using the excellent GoDoc site here:
http://godoc.org/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew

You can also view the documentation locally once the package is installed with
the `godoc` tool by running `godoc -http=":6060"` and pointing your browser to
http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew
```

## Quick Start

To dump a variable with full newlines, indentation, type, and pointer
information use Dump or Fdump:

```Go
spew.Dump(myVar1, myVar2, ...)
spew.Fdump(someWriter, myVar1, myVar2, ...)
```

Alternatively, if you would prefer to use format strings with a compacted inline
printing style, use the convenience wrappers Printf, Fprintf, etc with %v (most
compact), %+v (adds pointer addresses), %#v (adds types), or %#+v (adds types
and pointer addresses): 

```Go
spew.Printf("myVar1: %v -- myVar2: %+v", myVar1, myVar2)
spew.Printf("myVar3: %#v -- myVar4: %#+v", myVar3, myVar4)
spew.Fprintf(someWriter, "myVar1: %v -- myVar2: %+v", myVar1, myVar2)
spew.Fprintf(someWriter, "myVar3: %#v -- myVar4: %#+v", myVar3, myVar4)
```

## Sample Dump Output

```
(main.Foo) {
 unexportedField: (*main.Bar)(0xf84002e210)({
  flag: (main.Flag) flagTwo,
  data: (uintptr) <nil>
 }),
 ExportedField: (map[interface {}]interface {}) {
  (string) "one": (bool) true
 }
}
```

## Sample Formatter Output

Double pointer to a uint8:
```
	  %v: <**>5
	 %+v: <**>(0xf8400420d0->0xf8400420c8)5
	 %#v: (**uint8)5
	%#+v: (**uint8)(0xf8400420d0->0xf8400420c8)5
```

Pointer to circular struct with a uint8 field and a pointer to itself:
```
	  %v: <*>{1 <*><shown>}
	 %+v: <*>(0xf84003e260){ui8:1 c:<*>(0xf84003e260)<shown>}
	 %#v: (*main.circular){ui8:(uint8)1 c:(*main.circular)<shown>}
	%#+v: (*main.circular)(0xf84003e260){ui8:(uint8)1 c:(*main.circular)(0xf84003e260)<shown>}
```

## Configuration Options

Configuration of spew is handled by fields in the ConfigState type. For
convenience, all of the top-level functions use a global state available via the
spew.Config global.

It is also possible to create a ConfigState instance that provides methods
equivalent to the top-level functions. This allows concurrent configuration
options. See the ConfigState documentation for more details.

```
* Indent
	String to use for each indentation level for Dump functions.
	It is a single space by default.  A popular alternative is "\t".

* MaxDepth
	Maximum number of levels to descend into nested data structures.
	There is no limit by default.

* DisableMethods
	Disables invocation of error and Stringer interface methods.
	Method invocation is enabled by default.

* DisablePointerMethods
	Disables invocation of error and Stringer interface methods on types
	which only accept pointer receivers from non-pointer variables.
	Pointer method invocation is enabled by default.
